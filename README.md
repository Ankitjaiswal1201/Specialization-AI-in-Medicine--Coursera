# Specialization-AI-in-Medicine -Coursera

AI is transforming the practice of medicine. It’s helping doctors diagnose patients more accurately, make predictions about patients’ future health, and recommend better treatments. As an AI practitioner, the opportunity to join in this transformation of modern medicine is huge. 

This program gives practical experience in applying cutting-edge machine learning techniques to concrete problems in modern medicine: -
 In Course 1, I created convolutional neural network image classification and segmentation models to make diagnoses of lung and brain disorders. 
 In Course 2, I built risk models and survival estimators for heart disease using statistical methods and a random forest predictor to determine patient prognosis. 
 In Course 3, I built a treatment effect predictor, apply model interpretation techniques and use natural language processing to extract information from radiology reports. 
 
 These courses go beyond the foundations of deep learning to give you insight into the nuances of applying AI to medical use cases.
